Database Link](https://afcaps.us.af.mil/Pages/SecurityLogin.aspx)

The AFROTC Form 53 is used to gather personal and academic information on cadets for classification purposes and used in the production of Extended Active Duty (EAD) orders. The AFROTC Form 53 database will open in late January for input of cadet accounts for the CY22 classification cycle.

### Manual Form 53
The manual form 53 is usually done when a member misses the cycle of completing the database version and if the Cadet wants to go OSI (cadets MUST still complete a form 53 for their NON rated AFSC's)

Above is the PDF fill in version

Routing Form 53:
