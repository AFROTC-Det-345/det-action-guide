**Terminated:** If termination of scholarship occurs prior to tuition payment, remove estimate from WINGS  If a scholarship is terminated after payment, remove estimate for following term.

**Withdrawn:** If an HSSP scholarship recipient does not attend the institution where the scholarship will be activated the immediate fall term following the scholarship award cycle, and/or does not activate the scholarship during the required term, withdraw the scholarship. If an ICSP scholarship recipient does not activate the scholarship the term in which it was awarded, withdraw the scholarship. Once withdrawn by the Detachment or AFROTC/RRU, a scholarship cannot be reinstated. If eligible, cadets who have had a scholarship withdrawn may compete for a later HSSP or ICSP scholarship cycle.

## Extended Entitlements

The type of degree a Cadet is pursuing determines whether or not the cadet is entitled to "extended entitlements". Extended entitlements for scholarship cadets is only granted if they have a Secretary of the AF approved 5 year degree. When a cadet has a SAF approved 5 year degree, they are offered 300 more days of stipend pay and more coverage on tuition. Coverage on tuition entitlements will be covered on a month to month standard.

**Process on getting members with SAF approved 5 year degrees granted extended entitlements:**
1. Pull up an SMR spreadsheet
2. Filter it so it only displays AS400 cadets and determine who has a SAF approved degree by cross referencing Attachment 4 for SAF-Approved 5-Year Majors.
3. One week prior to an AS400 SPRING term **end **date, you must route an extended entitlements memorandum up to AFROTC/RRUE afrotc.rrue@us.af.mil.
