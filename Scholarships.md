## Extended Entitlements
Wednesday, November 24, 2021	12:40 PM

The type of degree a Cadet is pursuing determines whether or not the cadet is entitled to "extended entitlements". Extended entitlements for scholarship cadets is only granted if they have a Secretary of the AF approved 5 year degree. When a cadet has a SAF approved 5 year degree, they are offered 300 more days of stipend pay and more coverage on tuition. Coverage on tuition entitlements will be covered on a month to month standard.

**Process on getting members with SAF approved 5 year degrees granted extended entitlements:**
- Pull up an SMR spreadsheet
- Filter it so it only displays AS400 cadets and determine who has a SAF approved degree by cross referencing Attachment 4 for SAF-Approved 5-Year Majors.
- One week prior to an AS400 SPRING term **end **date, you must route an extended entitlements memorandum up to AFROTC/RRUE afrotc.rrue@us.af.mil.
