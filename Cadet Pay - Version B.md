## 257 How-to
The **only two **forms you will need in order to get this process started and accomplished is the Student Management Roster (SMR) and the Detachment's 257 report.

The Student Management Roster: Everything you need to know about **ALL** cadets (contracted/not contracted/pursuing etc..) that are a part of ROTC, is in this document.

257 Report: lists **ONLY **contracted cadets.

**How to pull/find documents:**

**SMR:**
- Log into Wings and Click on Cadet Reports
  
- Make sure it is under the "Enrolled/Loss" Tab
  
- Click on "SMR"
  
- Org ID will always be 1218, do not input any other information.
  
- Click Ok
  
- A new window will pop up, that is the SMR.

**257:**
- While you are still logged into Wings and inside "Cadet Reports"
  
- Click on the tab "Tuition/Pay"

![]()

- Click on "Monthly Pay Status"
  
- The example below will show you how the next screen will look like:
  
- The 257 report usually gets dropped the last week of each month, every first week of each month log into WINGS -\> Cadet Reports -\> tuition/pay -\> Monthly Pay Status and verify that they have dropped the 257 report.
  
- The "date prepared" should always be from the previous month that you are in (Example.. it is the first week of march, I will be looking for Feb's 257 report)
  
- Click "ok" and the 257 report will pop up.

**The Verification Process**

- First things first, before auditing both the SMR and 257 it's important to know AS levels/stipend entitlements.
*VERY IMPORTANT*

- **ONLY cadets who are CONTRACTED will be getting paid.**
- Below are the AS Levels and their subsistence pay:

**Step 1:**
- Now that we have covered how to pull up the SMR and 257 let's do our monthly audit and make sure the cadets are getting paid!
- Print out a copy of both your SMR and 257 report.
- The first document you will be reviewing will be the SMR.
**Step 2: (Reviewing the SMR)**

- When you are reviewing the SMR you will be looking for various things. I'm going to break down for what you will look for in GMC contracted cadets (AS 100-200) (250) and contracted POCs (300-400) (700/800). GMC can only contract if they have met all scholarship activation requirements. POC will be contracting after they have completed field training, will contract in the fall semester (NLT 10 calendar days from host term start date)

**GMC CONTRACTED CADETS (AS 100-200) (250):**

- When reviewing the SMR for GMC contracted cadets you will be verifying that their scholarship was "Activated". This means they have contracted with the AF.

- Below you will see an example of how you can tell if a GMC is contracted!

- Not only have I highlighted virtually on this "how to" but that is also what I do when I am auditing, so it'll be easier for me to know who is contracted. It'll help you as well!

- As you can see the above cadet is a GMC cadet due to being an AS 100 and is contracted with the AF due to his "Schlr Stat" being activated. You will continue this process until you get to the AS 300s. Congrats you are done verifying GMC cadets!

**POC CADETS (AS 300-400) (700/800):**

- When reviewing the SMR for POC cadets you will be verifying that they have an enlisted grade and the date they contracted.

- Below you will see an example of how you can tell if a POC is contracted. 99% of POC's all contract the Fall Semester after Field Training. The 1% are members who are guard/reserve that won't contract until 1 month out from Commissioning.

- Not only have I highlighted virtually on this "how to" but that is also what I do when I am auditing, so it'll be easier for me to know who is contracted. It'll help you as well!

**Congrats you are now done verifying all contracted cadets! Step 3: (reviewing the 257 report)**
- When you are reviewing the 257 you will be looking for various things. After you have finished reviewing the SMR, you will now verify that everyone who is contracted is getting paid appropriately on their 257. I have attached a screen shot of what each AS level's pay grade will be and how much they will be paid. Scroll up to "Subsistence Amount for Contract Cadets". That will come in handy when reviewing pay amount.

- Below you will see how to read a 257.

Name	Pay Rank Sex	Pay	(Book Fees)

**Start process:**

- Print out your 257 and start matching names with the SMR. For example "Cadet John Doe, is an AS 100 GMC but has a HSSP (high school scholarship)" so if members scholarship is activated he will be getting paid $300 on the 257.

- I will then review the 257 and verify he is getting paid the correct amount. Just like I

did with my SMR, where I highlighted information. I will be doing the same exact thing for the 257, it's just easier for you to track who is good to go.

- You will continue this process until you have verified everyone from who was listed as a contract cadet (or who you highlighted) is getting paid.

- Below is an example of how to match up the 257 and SMR.

- Cadet O'Malley is an AS100 which means his pay grade is SC01, $300.

- I will repeat this process until I have verified everyone has been paid!

**Step 4: (review any mistakes)**
- As you know with every program not everything is always going to be correct. Here are some common mistakes you may run into and how-to fix them.

1. Cadet not being paid correct amount of money.
2. Cadet stops getting paid.
3. Contract Cadet not on the 257 report.

- Below is our routing process of where to correct or find out more information about a cadets pay.
- Click on financials

- If you look at the below picture, I had to click on "Cadet Pay - Review" to have "Pay information at DFAS" pop up.

- Search any cadet, you only have to fill out just one of the criteria's listed.

- Below is an example of a Cadets "Pay information at DFAS"

- The tab "Bank Data" has all the Cadets Bank information listed. This is the first place I look to see why a cadet is not getting paid or not on the 257. I do that to make sure the member gave us his bank info to get paid.

- If you look at the very bottom of the below picture you will see a paper clip next to SF Form 1199A - this is their Direct Deposit form (Circled in Blue). This form is done when a member contracts and you are starting their pay (Continuity on this process is under "Cadet Pay 101 Start Pay Forms"). I click on the paper clip to make sure that the Bank info in WINGS is the same that the member filled out.

- When I see that the information is correct or I have made any changes by clicking save and going into "Proceed to Cadet Transactions to update DFAS" (this is where you go to update ANYTHING in Cadet Pay, Continuity for this will be under "Cadet Pay 101 How-to WINGS Slides") I go ahead and click on the "Academic Level" tab.

- Once I am in "academic level" I go ahead and look at two things

	I verify that they are under the correct Academic Level. \*Again remember\* any changes made to cadets pay must be saved and gone into "Proceed to Cadet Transactions to update DFAS" (this is where you go to update ANYTHING in Cadet Pay).
	1. I verify that their Estimated Last Day of Pay has not passed. (For training on Estimated Last Day of Pay, click under "Cadet Pay 101 How-to WINGS slides").

- Second place you can look at, to see why a cadet was not getting paid is in Cadet Transactions.

- While already in Financials, click the top left tab "Cadet - Pay Build" and then click

"Cadet Transactions"

- Search member

- Everything listed should be all updates you have made for a cadet. From building their record, to changing banks and AS levels etc.

- User ID lets you know who submitted each request.

- Now the reason this is section comes in handy is because when you click on "details" you can see if something went wrong in the system when updating any cadet information.

- **Below is an example of one of our cadets who was not on the 257 report.**

**Story Line: **one of our cadets switched banks. A month passed by and the 257 auditor realized and quickly notified the member they needed to give us the new bank information. The member did and the Cadre updated it.

The next month came around and the cadet still wasn't getting paid, so we then went into "Cadet Transactions" to find out what happened. HQ ended up having an issue with building all new cadet records at DFAS.

- This was all resolved due to the CADRE reviewing Cadet Pay records.

- Now that you have reviewed and verified everything, lets finalize the 257.

**Step 5: Finalizing 257 Report**

- When you are finalizing the 257 you must due 6 things before handing it off to the "Auditor" (usually an APAS)

1. Pull up a new current 257 (the one you just reviewed should be covered in highlighter) (scroll up if you forgot how to do)
   
2. Once you have it pulled up, Scroll all the way to the bottom of the 257 and input all the findings that you saw (below is an example of how I explain the findings and what actions I have taken to either resolve or explain discrepancies)

\1. After you have explained the findings, please copy the below signature blocks (they are not on the 257 report)

CADET PAY MONITOR SIGNATURE: 	(you sign
here)		DATE: 	

AUDITOR SIGNATURE:
(auditor)	
  
DATE:

COMMANDER SIGNATURE: 	(Col signs
here)		DATE: 	

1. Sign next to Cadet Pay Monitor, you will then give the APAS 3 different documents.

	Highlighted SMR
	1. Highlighted 257
	2. Finalized 257 (you just signed it)

He will then due the same identification process and audit his findings.

1. Now that the APAS has signed off, you will then schedule an Appt with the CC. Explain to him/her ANY findings and he/she will then sign.

1. Take finalized 257 and place it in the "257 Reports" binder so that when your det is having a "Self-Assessment" you will be compliant.
