## Weight Management Program

AFROTC will align with AFI 36 - 2905, Fitness Program, concerning BMI and body fat standards for AFROTC cadets. The new BMI maximum, regardless of a cadet’s gender, is 25 and the body fat limit for males is 18% and for females it is 26%.

**Forms** – Document weigh in and administrative actions via WINGs Counseling.

**BMI/Body Fat** – BMI/body fat measurements are not required for the term Fitness Assessment (FA) for cadets who pass the waist measurement; however, cadets who fail the waist measurement must have their BMI checked. If a cadet’s BMI exceeds 25 (over MAW for their height), then his/her body fat must be measured IAW DoDI 1308.3, DoD Physical Fitness and Body Fat Programs Procedures and AFI 36 - 2905. If the cadet’s body fat exceeds the limit, then he/she does not meet standards.

Cadets must meet the BMI/body fat standard to contract or commission. BMI/body fat must be measured within the 15 days prior to contracting, within 30 days prior to commissioning, and within 30 days prior to the end of the spring term for cadets attending Field Training IAW AFROTCI 36 - 2011
