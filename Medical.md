**HOW TO START THE DODMETS PROCESS**

Create a tracker to maintain accountability of the cadets DoDMETs status.

**DODMETS**

**Step 1: **Log into your DoDMETS account: https://www.dodmets.com/Dashboard/

- Click "detachment login"
- Username and Password will be given at one on one training.

- When you log in you can see all the applicants you have submitted and their status

**Step 2: **Click add new applicant

- Start filling out the cadets information
	- SSN-- no dashes
	- First Name/Last Name
	- Birth Date
	- Gender
	- Det Address
	- Cadets Email
	- Primary phone-- cadets phone number
	- Mobile phone--Det's phone number

- Under Preferences
	- Click "Detachment's Center Location (Postal Code 32114)"
	- Click "Add Applicant"
	- You should see this screen:

\*\*\* If you see the message below, the cadet either already started the process, or someone added them into DoDMETS and the account needs to be reactivated.

- Email the DoDMETS POCs and ask them to delete the account so the cadet can start the exam process. In the email you will give first and last name, last four of their

social, date of birth, and email address.

- If DoDMETS responds saying the cadet already has exams, you will email DoDMERB and ask them to transfer their profile to the applicable detachment. In the email give the first and last name, last four of their social, date of birth, and email address.

\*\*\*NOTE\*\*\* It may take a couple days for the applicants to get approved

**Step 3: **Once status says "approved" you will email the cadet with the instructions:

READ THE WHOLE
EMAIL\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Good Morning/Afternoon,
You now have the chance to accomplish your DoDMERB physical for AFROTC. If you are receiving this email and already have a DoDMERB, that means your current exams have expired. Please see the attached DoDMERB process slide above for step by step instructions (slides will be attached).

1. Schedule your optometry appointment ASAP. This appointment needs to happen first! If you wear contacts, please take them out NLT 72hrs before your optometry appointment.

2. The medical portion of the physical is walk-in only (no appointment required). Once you have the appointments scheduled email me with the date and times.

3. Go to the following website to fill out the paperwork/questionnaire and take it with you to BOTH appointments.
- https://www.dodmets.com/

- To login to this website you will click on Student Site and login. Your initial user name

will be your social security number and your initial password will be your last name. Once you have completed the questionnaires, you will print the packet out to take with you to your appointments!

- \*\*\*\*When filling out the questionnaires, do not answer yes to any medical question unless a Doctor has actually diagnosed you with that certain condition. If a remedial comes back on you then you will have to provide medical documentation to be cleared! \*\*\*\*

- Also, these appointments are paid by the Air Force. No out of pocket costs!

- You have 45 days to complete all medical requirements or your account will be deleted!

\*\* IF YOU DON’T ACCOMPLISH THIS BY THE SUSPENSE YOU WILL GET A CONDITIONAL EVENT.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

\*\*\*Additional Information\*\*\*

After the appointments are accomplished, it can take anywhere between a week to a month for the exams to be sent to DoDMERB, depending on the medical history of that cadet.
- You can check the status of the cadet in DoDMETS
	- Once the status says "closed" the documents have been sent to DoDMERB

- Pending Waiver Review/Submission: Once you submit the documents requested from HQs, to DoDMERB, DoDMERB will review them (usually takes 15 days) and then will post the new documents to the waiver authority (SG) and once the medical status says "pending" you will send an email to HQs requesting them to review for a waiver.
