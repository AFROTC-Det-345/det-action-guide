## Academic Plan
IAW AFROTCI36-2011, cadre must keep a current academic plan on file of active cadets. Through the academic plan, cadets must demonstrate their ability to meet degree requirements, in alignment with their projected DOC/DOG. At a minimum, cadre will review the academic plan during the fall term of each academic year to ensure the cadet is on track. It is recommended that the academic plan also be revisited during the spring term.

Cadets should be encouraged to have their plan reviewed by an academic advisor from their university to avoid delays in graduation/commissioning. Updates should be made accordingly based on course pass/fail and adjustments to projected course completion.
