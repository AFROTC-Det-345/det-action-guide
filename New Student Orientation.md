# New Student Orientation
## Virtual NSO

## Process overview:
- Pull list of applicants signed up for AF101L and AF201L from Campus Solutions.
	- If you do not have access to campus solutions, get with the AS100 APAS to pull the class roster.
	- To ensure all students are accounted for, you will want to get an updated list weekly.
- Send email (example below) to applicants with information on how to complete the process, along with a video guide.
- Students will email their documents to their respective NCO, and that NCO will review the documents and save in the ShareDrive. The BC/SSN/SAT/ACT/Misc documents will be uploaded to a secure drop-box.
- Once all the documents are saved to the ShareDrive, the APAS will upload the documents into WINGS.
- On the day of orientation, the cadre will verify the birth certificate, social security card, selective service (for males 18+), and ensure the student has no civil involvements to report. (If the student reports civil involvements, they will meet with the CC in a separate NSO group).
	- The students will be broken up into four groups:
		- Alpha- HSSP NSO (will follow c/POC to separate room)
		- Bravo- Stayed in place (auditorium)
		- Charlie- Civil Involvements (will follow c/POC to separate room)
		- Delta- New shows (will follow c/POC to separate room)
			**These are just suggestions, and can be applied/changed as necessary to fit detachment needs.**
- After orientation is complete, the cadre will work together to get the remaining requirements in order to gain the cadets.

**Initial Email example**
AFROTC Det 157 Applicant,

**\*\*\*READ THE ENTIRE EMAIL\*\*\***

**\*\*\*ALL ACTIONS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1200, 15 AUG 21\*\*\* **

**Welcome**

I'm Technical Sergeant Anastacia Harris, the Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge for  Detachment 157. On behalf of the Commander, Colonel Alan Dayton, I'd like to thank you

for your interest in the AFROTC program and your interest in pursuing a commission in the US Air Force or US Space Force.

Our detachment has existed since 1972 and has many traditions and standardized ways of training our cadets. As things get back to "normal" from COVID-19, we will be transitioning into being in larger groups and forums. Our cadre asks for your flexibility and understanding as we navigate the new norm and get back to operating at full capacity this school year.

As a cadet in AFROTC, we expect that you maintain personal accountability and motivation for yourself, progress, and academic careers. You will have to maintain your own fitness, navigate technological and communication challenges, and find a way to build camaraderie among your peers. The cadre, along with your cadet wing and leaders will be with you every step of the way!

Some of you will rise to this challenge and flourish despite the many obstacles you'll be faced with. Others will not, and will quit the program or not even finish the application process. That's ok, we expect both, as only 1 in 4 freshmen that join the program will commission as an officer.

**New Student Orientation Process (NSOP)**

Please carefully work your way through this process with the utmost attention to detail. We have tried to streamline the process as much as possible, but you may still have questions. If you do have questions, please email us at dbafnsop@erau.edu and we will try to help you with the process.

**Step 1 – Watch NSOP Video & Submit Required Documents**

To get started with NSOP, please watch this video, which will guide you through the rest of the process.

AFROTC Det 157 In-processing (NSOP) Instruction Video (Updated)

**Video Resources**

Use the below links to access the forms/website that require completion: WINGS: https://wings.holmcenter.com/



Once all of your documents are complete, Submit them via requested method.

The below apps are free scanning apps will assist with viewing/completing the documents if you run into trouble:
Adobe Scan (iOS): https://rb.gy/5atfgv
Adobe Scan (Android): https://rb.gy/khtprc

Microsoft Office Lens (iOS): https://rb.gy/uro1kh
Microsoft Office Lens (Android): https://rb.gy/ukvpgn

**Step 2 - Document Review**

After your submission, your documents will be reviewed by our cadre and we will determine if you meet the requirements to join the AFROTC program. We will contact you when you have been given a "green light" and you will be allowed to attend the in-person NSOP Appointment. If you are not eligible for the program, we will contact you directly and let you know the issue, and if it's something that could be fixed or if you need to wait until next year, etc.

**Step 3 – Attend the In-person in-processing appointment (25 August @ 0700)**

Once you have received our “Acceptance Email,” you will need to attend our In-Person New Student Orientation Brief on **25 August at 0700**. The brief will be located in BLDG IC101, Willie Miller Instructional Center, on the ERAU campus. More information about this appointment (what to wear, what to bring, etc.) will be described in our “acceptance email”.

**Step 4 – Start Attending Class and Training**

If you signed up for AF101 (or equivalent for our cross-town schools), your class will be on Wednesdays. 30 August is the first day of school for ERAU. Wednesday, 01 September, will be our first Leadership Laboratory. Details will follow once you're in the program on where and when to show up for this training.

**Cadet Mentor contact info**

If you have questions about the AFROTC program that are **NOT **related to NSOP, but are instead about the program in general from a cadet perspective, please reach out to the senior cadets below, depending on the **first letter of your last name**:

- **A-H: **Cadet Major Kayla Faircloth, contacted at fairclk1@my.erau.edu
- **I-P: **Cadet Major Tyler Carr, contacted at carrt9@my.erau.edu
- **Q-Z: **Cadet Major Kyla O’Connor, contacted at oconnk13@my.erau.edu

They will attempt to answer your questions and share their experiences with the program.

**Additional Form 28 information**

If you already have a cleared DoDMERB medical exam, you do not need to complete the Form 28.

For those of your attending ERAU, the Health Services department will schedule appointments to obtain the sports physical. Please call 386-226-7917. This physical allows you to participate in PT and LLAB; it is mandatory for those that do not have an approved DODMERB.

Thank you again for your interest in the program. We look forward to showing you what the Air Force and Space Force have to offer.

**"Acceptance" Email example**
**\*\*\*Update/change this email as it applies to your detachment\*\*\***
This email was sent after we had reviewed their Civil Involvements and other documents and determined they could join the det as a cadet. After all other checkboxes on the Enrollment/Classification page in WINGS are 'green,' this is how the cadets log in to certify that they have no other civil involvements to report, and is the last step to take before you can make them an active cadet! Also, you have to make them active within approximately 24 hours of them signing this page, or it'll expire and you'll have to do it again!

Hello,

We've reviewed your documents and are pleased to welcome you to Det 157 as a cadet! Here are the next steps you need to complete.
**Step 1**
- Login to WINGS https://wings.holmcenter.com/
- Click on "Quick Links"
- Then click on "Civil Involve. Certifications" on the left
- Click "Add Certification"
- Click the checkbox to the left of the statement
- Enter your password and click Sign/Submit
- The cadre will need a copy of tickets, school expulsion, arrests, supporting documentation, etc.


**Step 2-**Email dbafnsop@erau.edu that you have completed the CI Certification step The cadre will then login and make you an active cadet in WINGS.

**Step 3 – **Contact the NCOs using db157nco@erau.edu, to confirm that you are ready to complete NSOP and there you will fill out remaining AFROTC documents and pick-up your uniform items with your Form 28.

**Step 4 – **Show up to the Willie Miller BLDG (IC101) at the appointed time (DATE, TIME).

Here is the location of the building: https://goo.gl/maps/KfFncEvoohwtsH4k6 Park in the green-bordered area.
There will be cadets ready to help you find where to enter and to show you which room you will be in.

**What to wear**
- White, black, or dark blue polo shirt
- Khaki pants
- Belt
- Conservative closed-toed shoes

**Items to bring with you**
- Your Form 28 - Sports Physical. Bring a physical copy **even if you've already submitted it electronically**. This will be your "ticket" for participation in PT and LLAB.
- Birth Certificate, Social Security Card, and the AFROTC Document Checklist w/applicable documents.
- If you have a cleared/qualified DoDMERB physical, bring that instead of the form 28.
- If you don't have a Form 28 or DoDMERB, come to in-processing anyway, but you will not be able to participate in PT and LLAB until we have the FM 28 or DODMERB. ERAU students can make a appointment with Health Services on campus to accomplish this document: https://eraudaytona.studenthealthportal.com/
- $50 to pay your dues to "Eagle Wing", the cadet's booster club. This will get you the mandatory Det 157 Blue Polo shirt which you will wear with khaki pants at the beginning of the program until you are issued uniforms. It will also include a backpack hydration system which will be required for PT (physical training). Finally, it will give you access to the Student Lounge, where you can enjoy snacks and drinks such as cereal/sandwiches/popsicles/fruit/popcorn, etc. throughout the semester. (the dues for subsequent semesters will be lower, usually only $25)

**Please note that failure to bring the required documents, no show(s) to the New  [Stud][2]ent Orientation Briefing, and non-responsiveness may affect your ability to  participate in AFROTC. If you have any issues, or an emergency that prevents you  from attending the New Student Orientation Brief, please contact the NCO office  (**db157nco@erau.edu), or assigned NCO immediately! 

**Step 5 – **Show up to class or training.

If you are signed up for the Wednesday AF101 course, your first class will be 01 September.

The first Leadership Laboratory (for everyone) will be 01 September at 0630. You will receive more instructions on when and where to show up from your flight commander, once you're assigned a flight.

As always, let me know if you have questions.

## Classifying a Cadet
Wednesday, November 24, 2021	11:37 AM

**Step 1-**Go to https://wings.holmcenter.com/ and click the "Sign In" tile

Input your User ID and Password

**Step 2: **Select the "WINGS" tile

**Step 3: **Select the "Cadet Data" tile


**Step 4: **On the left hand side of the page, select "Enrollment/Classification" and verify/complete necessary actions to be able to classify the cadet as "active"

Find the applicant you are working with.
- You will see a table with a series of boxes like this:
	

If you see a blank box, no action has been taken; if there is a green check mark, action is complete; if there is a red X, then a follow-up action needs to be made ( you may see this on: CIs, CI Certification, Screening Questions)
- If the box is blank or does not have a green check, select the box to see what action is required.

\*\*\*ACTIONS TO COMPLETE\*\*\*

**Enrollment Eligibility:**

Using the original or certified true copies of the Birth Certificate, Passport (for citizenship), and Social Security Card, verify the information in this box is accurate. Once information is verified, place your cursor in the blank box in the upper right corner of the section and click in the box so a green check appears (see example below).

Next, use the BC, passport, or proof of naturalization to verify citizenship. Once verified, toggle the box that says, "I have reviewed this individuals original birth certificate, proof of naturalization, or current U.S. passport to certify U.S. citizenship." If the cadet is a "Non-US" citizen, see the Non-
U.S. citizen tab of this OneNote.

Once all of the boxes are green, you will be able to move on and the "Enrollment Eligibility" box will have a green check in it on the home page.


**Youth/Military Experience:**

If the applicant has not prior military experience, the option will be toggled no. If yes, then you will need the applicant's DD214. If the applicant is male and 18 years of age or older, input their selective service number if the box is blank.
- Indicate whether or not the applicant has JROTC experience.
	- Verify whether or not the applicant has indicated awards, scouting experience, or prior officer training
		- Awards and experience are important when it comes to contracting because it can influence their pay grade
	- After all of the information has been verified, select the boxes in the upper right corner of each section, then click "apply" and then "ok" (example below).


**Screening Questions:**

Make sure these are all checked with a green check. If they are incomplete, have the applicant complete their questions. If there is a red X, additional actions must be taken. Typically these actions are related to DoDMERB (click the red X associated with this question and indicate the action that will be taken. i.e. requesting DoDMERB be transferred to the det) or admission of drug use (officer cadre will have to meet with the cadet to sign this one off. They will click on the red X and then indicate action taken). When complete, all the boxes will be green (see below example).

**Application Documents:**

Upload requested documents. All other documents (if not uploaded when creating the cadet) will be uploaded into the vUPRG. Once uploaded, select "apply" and then "ok."

**Civil Involvements:**

If the applicant has no civil involvements reported, the box will automatically have a green check. If there is a red X indicated, the CI must be approved. All supporting documents from the incident must be attached to the involvement. (See below)


The applicant will need to provide:
Date of incident
- Date it was reported to cadre
	- Time it was reported to cadre
		- Indicate the involvement type
		- Summary of the incident
		- Indicate if they were detained, confined, or received probation
		- Indicate if drugs or alcohol were cited in the report
		- At a minimum, upload the required supporting document
		- The cadre will indicate the type of offense (select the magnifying class next to the offense box)
	- Once all of these inputs are made, the cadre will summarize what occurred and then select "report/save." This will send the CI to the detachment commander so he/she can review and either waive or disapprove the CI depending on the category of severity.
	- Once all entries are made, there will be a green "ok" in place of the red X.

	**Certification:**

	If the applicant has not signed off on the C.I. already, click in the blank box and the below example will appear:


Select "Add Certification"
After reading the prompt stating the cadet's presence is required, select "ok"
- Have the applicant read the statement, once finished toggle the empty box next to the statement
	- Have the applicant input their Wings password
		- Select "Sign/Submit"

**Step 5: **Select "Classify Cadet"
Toggle "Active Cadet"
Indicate the term
- Indicate the AS level (AS100 for Freshman (zero AFROTC experience, AS250 for Sophomores conducting their first year of AFROTC)
	- Click "submit"

\*\*\*NOTE\*\*\*
You can indicate the cadet as "applicant" if they are missing requirements such as paperwork, etc. (not citizenship related); or, you can indicate the applicant is a "participant" if they are not interested in pursuing a commission and are just taking AFROTC classes for credit.

## Cadet Self-Civil Involvement Certification
Tuesday, December 7, 2021	10:36 AM

Once cadets have completed all other enrollment actions, cadets must certify their civil involvements, prior to being classified as an active cadet, in the appropriate AS level. This can be done in-person (see "Classifying Cadet") or virtually, if required.

The guide below can be downloaded and provided to cadets once all other enrollment actions are complete.
