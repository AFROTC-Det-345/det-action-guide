# Additional Duties (WIP)

## VCO

## GPC
### Description 
This program is the same as the GPC program at a base,with a few exceptions. (Approval official accounts, etc.)

You will need to contact your Region Budget Analyst to initiate training, receive your card, and get access to Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment (PIEE), the web-based program used to reconcile your purchases.

### AFROTC Differences
In AFROTC your CC will approve purchases,but your PIEE approving official is your AFROTC rep.

You will also have several accounting codes that you will have to track for different Det functions which include, but are not limited to:
- general support 
- furniture 
- Center of Influence 
- Leadership Lab Incentive Program
- Unit Admissions Office 
- postage 
- parking  

### Responsibility
While there will be different POCs for some of the above programs, you are ultimately responsible for the use of the card. It is important that you establish a system to manage the different accounts and that you are aware of the regulations and rules established on spending for each program.
