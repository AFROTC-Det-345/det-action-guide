## Welcome to AFROTC Duty WELCOME TO ROTC PAGE

Congratulations on your selection to AFROTC and welcome to one of the most dynamic and rewarding
assignments in the United States Air Force. You will quickly learn that this assignment will be unlike any
other assignment you have ever had, and that the instructions and policies that govern your day to day
activities will be your guiding light through this journey.

We hope to ease the learning curve by providing you enough information to help you "Survive" the first few
months prior to your formal AFROTC Cadre training. We hope you will find the next four years challenging
and rewarding.

This Survival Guide is designed to outline many of the NCO duties. Our goal is to provide you with a road
map that will help you navigate the many different instructions and policies in AFROTC. This guide does
not provide step-by-step instructions. It is designed to describe what you do and where to find the proper
references. You will get an idea on how things are run at an established and proven detachment, but there
are 144 different ways of doing things. Be sure to ALWAYS verify the currency of regulations and policies.

## Cadet Records/Application Process CADET PERSONNEL ACTIONS

```
CADET RECORDS/APPLICATIONS PROCESS
AFROTCI 36 - 2011
```
Description **–** Cadets version of Active Duty UPRG. You are allowed to maintain paper records however,
AFROTC is looking to have all cadet records uploaded in WINGS (vUPRG). Your cadet records are extremely
vital to your detachments mission. A well maintained and organized cadet record will immediately speak
volumes about your detachment to visiting Detachment Inspection Teams. It will also help aide in avoiding
erroneous enlistments, keeping track of critical counseling requirements, and staying on top of a cadet’s life
cycle.

Section Components if you maintain paper records **–** AFROTC Form 26 - Cadet Records Inventory
Sections 1 - 4 (mandatory coversheets located on the Intranet).

Life Cycle **–** When to complete forms:

- The Det will establish an AF Form 10, Unit Personnel Record Group (Folder), to contain forms and other
records. File the documents in the following sections: Section I, Guidance Records, Correspondence, and
Orders; Section II, Evaluation Instruments; Section III, Records of Membership; and Section IV, Medical

```
*Note 1 : Participating Students are those who are registered in AS courses but do not seek a commission.
Participating students are not cadets, and the following apply: Must create a WINGS record; however are
not required to complete the application for AFROTC membership; May enroll in AFROTC classes for
academic course credit only; Will not be issued uniforms.
```
```
*Note 2 : Incoming GMC applicants are required to complete the Web-enrollment, refer to AFI 36 - 2011
Ch.3 for all application/enrollment procedures.
```
Record Reviews **–** Cadet Record and Student Management Roster (SMR) reviews should be conducted at
least one session per year. Based on this requirement, and the fact that your records really do ‘make’ or
‘break’ you, everyone in the Det should get together once a year, either during the Summer or Fall break, to
conduct a thorough records review. It’s best to meet in a room with a large table and go through your first
few records together. This is a time-consuming task, so be sure to allow sufficient time to complete each
record.

- Reference AFROTC Guide Admissions Process & AFROTC Applicant Admission Process Guide via
CCV Intranet site

## Student Management Roster (SMR)

Description: The accuracy of WINGS data is critical; HQ AFROTC uses it for selecting cadets for
enrollment allocations, rated slots, and other career-impacting situations. The “Student Management
Roster” or SMR is the main document you will use to keep track of your students. You can use this roster
to annotate any changes, look for and correct possible errors, and make sure your WINGS data is current.

*This section describes the main terms and explain the _‘key’_ items to look for. Although you will gain a
_“true”_ basic understanding of the SMR Roster with time, we hope these short descriptions help give you to
quickly grasp and understand this critical roster:


- The SMR is a standard 4 column, 8 - row version that outputs 12 cadets per page (titled "SMR") when you
leave the EMPLID blank or a single cadet when you provide a specific EMPLID
- Identifying info terms in the SMR that you may not be familiar with:

```
- EMPLID – This is just a code that is used in place of the SSN and is 7 numbers long
- FICE CODE – This is a 6 - number code that lets you know which school the cadet is attending
under your host school.
- LAST DP – This is the Last day of Pay for the Cadet. This is never after the commissioning date
- FT – is a short term for Field Training
- Cat Sel – This is the results for Categorization Selections
- MRS – This is for Medical Remedial Status to let you know that you have a Cadet with a medical
problem that is pending at AETC
```
## Membership Action Checklist (AFROTC Form 63 )

Description **–** The AFROTC Form 63 is one of the most important checklists you will utilize while in
AFROTC. It is designed to ensure all membership eligibility requirements are met and that all
actions/membership documents are completed at the appropriate time. Additionally, this document is an
enlistment checklist, therefore, adhere strictly to the AFROTC Form 63 and you will avoid erroneous
enlistments.

When to complete **–** Section I is completed at the time of initial application; Section II is completed just prior
to enlistment; Section III is completed after enlistment occurs.

## Cadet Medical

AFROTCI 36-2011/CADET MEDICAL PROCESSING GUIDE

Description **–** Cadets require physicals to qualify for various events or programs. To contract (enlist),
activate a scholarship, attend field training, PDT’s and to commission. All physicals remain valid UNLESS
there is a change in medical status or there is a break in service (i.e. cadet is disenrolled but, remains in
program).

*refer to Medical Processing Guide

Types **–** Types of physicals depend on where the cadet received the physical and what the cadet needs the
physical for.

Places/Facilities/Agencies – All AFROTC physicals are accomplished by three agencies, Department of
Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DoDMERB), Medical Examination Processing Stations
(MEPS), and Military Treatment Facilities (MTF).

DoDMERB PHYSICALS

Used for:

1. Scholarship Activation (this is the ONLY physical you can use for scholarship activation)
2. Enlistment
3. Field Training


4. Categorization (If it meets pre-screening standards in WINGS)
5. Commissioning (not for cadets with special physical requirements mentioned in MTF/IFC sections)

Validity Period:

- DoDMERB physicals are valid for 24 months from the date of the exam for contracting (scholarship, non-
scholarship or POC)

```
**There is no extension beyond the 24 months for contracting**
```
- Once contracted the DoDMERB physical becomes valid for 48 months from the date of the certification stamp

```
**If the physical is going to be older than 48 months at the time of commissioning, then the physical can
be submitted for an extension IAW the Medical Processing Guide**
```
Waiver Authority – HQ AETC/SGPS is the FINAL medical waiver authority for any medical conditions.

Timeframe (for enlistment purposes) – Schedule as soon as CC believes the individual is a viable
candidate (Check CGPA, AFOQT, PFA, Ht/Wt standards, full-time student status, and academic plan);
determine if potentially eligible for a scholarship (remember that the cadet must have a DoDMERB physical
in order to activate ANY scholarship offer).

MEPS PHYSICALS

Used for:

1. Enlistment (non-scholarship)
2. Field Training
3. Commissioning (not for cadets with special physical requirements mentioned in MTF/IFC sections)

Validity Period:

Potential Pilot/Remotely Piloted Aircraft / Navigator Qualification (PPQ/PRPQ/PNQ)
Candidates
```
Use WINGS Rated Screening Exam module to enter the information from the cadet’s DoDMERB or
MEPS physical to see if they are potentially qualified for pilot, RPA, CSO, or ABM. This will allow them
to compete for categorization. Ensure the cadet knows that this is a general guideline and not a
guaranteed qualification.

## Physical Fitness Requirements

Description **–** Cadets are required to meet the same PT standards as active duty personnel. Detachments
must develop a PT program to enhance the fitness level of cadets and prepare them to meet AF PFA
requirements. It should be designed to motivate cadets to pursue a physically fit and active lifestyle. Before
they can participate in ANY AFROTC PT activities, cadets must meet the requirements listed below.

Pre-participatory Requirement: The PTL must ensure the following are located in the Cadet’s vUPRG
prior to PT participation:

- AFROTC Form 28, Pre-Participatory Sports Physical, must accomplished upon program entry

attendance keeping for PT sessions.

WINGS Update **–** Record cadet PFA scores and BMI/BF measurements in WINGS

## Weight Management Program

Description **–** AFROTC will align with AFI 36 - 2905, Fitness Program, concerning BMI and body fat
standards for AFROTC cadets. The new BMI maximum, regardless of a cadet’s gender, is 25 and the body
fat limit for males is 18% and for females it is 26%.

Forms **–** Document weigh in and administrative actions via WINGs Counseling.

BMI/Body Fat – BMI/body fat measurements are not required for the term Fitness Assessment (FA) for
cadets who pass the waist measurement; however, cadets who fail the waist measurement must have their
BMI checked. If a cadet’s BMI exceeds 25 (over MAW for their height), then his/her body fat must be
measured IAW DoDI 1308.3, DoD Physical Fitness and Body Fat Programs Procedures and AFI 36 - 2905. If
the cadet’s body fat exceeds the limit, then he/she does not meet standards.

Cadets must meet the BMI/body fat standard to contract or commission. BMI/body fat must be measured
within the 15 days prior to contracting, within 30 days prior to commissioning, and within 30 days prior to the
end of the spring term for cadets attending Field Training IAW AFROTCI 36 - 2011.

## Enlistment/Contracting

Description **–** You are probably very familiar with the term "Enlistment". You may not however, be familiar
with AFROTC's requirements or terminology for enlistment in the United States Air Force Reserve. The term
"Contracting" is synonymous with “Enlistment”. Every applicant selected for POC membership will
normally be enlisted into the Air Force Reserve Obligated Reserve Section (ORS) before becoming a POC
member. All scholarship program designees must also be enlisted in the ORS before their scholarship can be
activated. Before enlistment in the ORS, a POC applicant or scholarship designee must normally fulfill all
eligibility requirements. BEFORE you complete ANY enlistment, please read and become familiar with
AFROTCI 36 - 2011 and AFROTC Form 63.

Eligibility **–** Determine eligibility by completing Section I of AFROTC Form 63. This should satisfy all the
pre-enlistment qualifications. Review eligibility requirements again in AFROTCI 36 - 2011 just prior to
enlistment (weight, PFA Score, GPA, and valid physical).

Forms **–** Listed on AFROTC Form 63 Section II:

- Blank: AF1056, DD Form 4, and AFROTC Form 88 (4-yr scholarship technical winner w/SAF-
approved 5 - yr major) or Attachment 3 (academic plan for foreign language or technical requirement for
non-technical scholarship cadets) –

```
*Note 1: Ensure ALL pre-enlistment requirements are met before cadet signs AF1056 & DD Form
4!!
```
```
*Note 2 : Check age of cadet – parent/legal guardian may need to sign
```

AFROTCI 36- 2011

- Forms to be recertified: Civil Involvements in WINGS and AF Form 2030
- Determine appropriate enlistment grade for AF1056 and DD Form 4 (AFMAN 36-2032))
- It is important that you are using the most recent forms. Prior to each contracting you should check your
AFROTC Form 63, AF1056, and DD Form 4

```
**When going through the Enlistment process, it is important that you follow the procedures listed in
AFROTCI 36 - 2011 and the AFROTC Form 63 to the letter. This should keep you from having any
erroneous enlistments and administrative errors**
```
Post Enlistment Actions

- AFROTC Form 63 Section III
- Activate scholarships/start pay
- Upload enlistment/contracting documents to WINGS
- Reserve orders (Ensure you update the order number on applicable FY ‘Reserve Orders’ log)

## Security Clearance

## Test of Basic Aviation Skills (TBAS)

Description - The Test of Basic Aviation Skills is a tool used to measure an individual’s capability for pilot or
remotely piloted training. This test must be performed in order to get a Pilot Candidate Selection Method
(PCSM) score. The TBAS along with AFOQT pilot score and number of flying hours are used to calculate
the PCSM score. The PCSM scores part of the Order of Merit calculation used for rated categorization
selection.

- If you do not have a TBAS machine at your detachment, it is your responsibility to ensure that your cadets
interested in competing for pilot categorization get to a testing facility (USAF installation, MEPS or
another detachment)
- If you are appointed as a TBAS Operator, you are responsible for the following:
- Maintaining the most current publications listed above
- Take the TBAS (preferred in case you have to answer questions) or sign a statement of
understanding
- After initial TBAS training, complete TBAS training each August
- Ensure the test file, candidate worksheet, transcripts, and copies of the individual flight log are e-
mailed to the PCSM admin office pcsm.admin@randolph.af.mil in a timely manner
- To check for the PCSM go to https://pcsm.aetc.af.mil/
- Change access password annually
- If cadet has flight hours to log after initial TBAS/PCSM, scan a copy of the log book and complete the
Flight Hour Update memo (template located at https://access.afpc.af.mil/pcsmdmz/forms.html)
- Email the memo and copy of the log book to afpc.pcsm@us.af.mil (only 2 score updates can be
processed per email)


AFROTCI 36- 2011

## Selection Boards

Description – The first week in March. Is when HQ AFROTC conducts selections boards for the POC
Selection Process (PSP) and Rated Boards (Pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM). Detachment preparation is critical in
order to be successful and to ensure that your cadets are nominated for the appropriate board. Preparation
should occur in the weeks and months leading up to the boards. HQ will normally shut down certain
portions of WINGS a week prior to the board in order to pull the information needed for these boards. You
will normally start seeing ARMS messages in Oct/Nov to start getting prepared for this process and to let
you know what the nomination timelines will be:

PSP – important information to check for this board are:

- Accurate DOG/DOC in WINGS, on contract (if applicable), and on AFROTC Form 48
- Accurate Major in WINGS, on contract (if applicable), and on AFROTC Form 48

```
*NOTE: These two items are very important when deciding type and FY of enrollment allocations. If there
are any discrepancies in these areas, you must take immediate action to correct it. Corrections may range
from having the cadet correct their Form 48 to a trouble ticket, or may even require a Form 22 waiver
request
```
- Most current PFA scores and height/weight in WINGS (to ensure eligibility)
- Most current GPA in WINGS (to ensure eligibility)
- Updated AFOQT scores in WINGS
- Updated SAT/ACT scores in WINGS
- Updated physical information in WINGS (all cadets must either be medically cleared or be scheduled for
a physical)
- Identify the cadets that will be seeking a Nursing, Dental or Pre-Med enrollment allocation

- Once the review is complete and necessary updates have been made, you will use the appropriate
WINGS Checklists along with your Commander’s ratings to nominate/rank the cadets for PSP

Pilot/RPA/CSO/ABM Categorization – HQ AFROTC will select cadets that will categorize into pilot, RPA,
CSO, and air battle manager for the upcoming fiscal year. It is important that you find out early which cadets in
your detachment are going to compete for these positions.

Categorization preparation:

- Ensure candidates meet the AFOQT requirement outlined in AFROTCI 36 - 2011
- Ensure candidates meet medical requirements using the PPQ/PRQ/PNQ Checklist in WINGS
- Ensure all pilot candidates have taken the TBAS and have a PCSM score
- Use appropriate WINGS checklist to nominate cadets for the category in which they will compete
- Use appropriate WINGS checklist and CC ratings to rank order all cadets graduating in that FY

```
*NOTE: Upon receipt of cadet’s new category, complete a change page to the AF IMT 1056 within 10
workdays of cadet notification, and have TS security clearance submitted within 30 days.
```

AFROTCI 36-2011/FT+PDT EXECUTION PLAN

AFROTCI 36- 2011

## Field Training/Professional Development Training (PDT)

Description – Field Training (FT) and Professional Development Training (PDT) are programs that
happen during the summer when AFROTC classes are not in session.

- Field Training, which is the AFROTC version of Basic Training, is mandatory for all cadets to attend in
order to commission. They normally attend FT between their sophomore and junior year (after they
have received an enrollment allocation).

- There are different PDTs available for GMC and POC cadets based on their scholarship types and what
they are interested in. These trips are to learn more about Air Force life, observe what happens at a base
by shadowing officer and enlisted personnel.

- Some FT prep will occur in the fall and early spring such as ensuring cadets have a current physical or
getting them scheduled for physicals if they do not have them yet. The majority of preparation will
occur after notification of an enrollment allocation and will be attending FT. After this happens, you will
use the appropriate WINGS checklists to load the cadets for FT sessions, and also to print their orders.
You will receive instructions and timelines from ARMS messages. You will follow existing guidance at
your detachment to set up travel arrangements (either through local agencies or your servicing base).
You will need this info, along with the government travel rate, to have accurate orders from WINGS.

- The ball normally gets rolling on the PDT process in the Fall term with the cadets doing volunteer
statements. Normally the COC and cadets who have been on PDTs will brief cadets on the opportunities
and types of PDTs. Once the cadets have decided what they would like to do, the process flows similar to
FT. You will use WINGS checklists to nominate the cadets for the PDT they would like. Once they are
loaded by HQ for the appropriate PDT, you will set up the travel, and then use the appropriate WINGS
checklist to load that information and print the orders.

- Reference PDT Processing Guide via CCV intranet site

## HQ Waiver Request (AFROTC Form 22/CPAR)

Description – Det/CCs may request a waiver for cadets and applicants who fail to meet eligibility
requirements or for contract cadets who fail to maintain retention standards.

Commander Retention Review (CRR) – A CRR is the Det/CC’s preliminary examination of a cadet’s
failure(s) to maintain standards. Det/CCs will collect known information regarding the cadet’s situation and
coordinate findings and recommendation with the Region/CC, who will in turn determine whether the CRR will
result in retention, probation, or disenrollment action.

DISENROLLMENTS

Description **–** Disenrollment’s apply only to contract cadets. There are numerous reasons for which a cadet
can/should be disenrolled. There are two types of Disenrollment’s: Investigative and Non- Investigative.
Disenrollment case files must be submitted for both types. Documentation is the key to a strong case file.
Typical disenrollment decisions are: No action; recoupment of scholarship monies; and called to enlisted
active duty.

- Disenrollment’s are submitted via WINGS, Reference the Disenrollment Guide via the CCV intranet
site

CLASSIFICATIONS & ASSIGNMENTS

Description – Classification is the process by which cadets are given their AFSCs. Assignments are
processed in much the same way. It is a two-p a r t process which is broken down into three phases for each
process. The program is administered via the AFROTC Form 53 Website.

Timeframe – Cadet AFSC nominations and assignments are accomplished the Fall of the cadet’s senior
year.

Access – Contact your region for Form 53 access and password.

Process – An ARMS message will be sent by HQ ROTC once the Form 53 Webpage is open. Once it is
open the technician (you) will have to grant the cadet access to the website. The application process is as
follows:

- Cadet Phase – Each cadet enters information concerning their coursework, projected date of
graduation, foreign language skills, prior service history, joint spouse requirements, and AFSC and
location preferences.

- Technician Phase (TEC) – The technician verifies the accuracy of the cadet’s data before forwarding
the data to the detachment commander for final review or returning the data to the cadet to be
modified.

approved
- Detachments have 5 calendar days, after receipt, to process an invoice
