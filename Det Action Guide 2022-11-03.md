The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Detachment Action Guide is an interactive and collaborative tool developed and managed by the Cadre Development Team (CDT), under the guise of AFROTC/CCVT, Cadre Training. This guide is designed to provide cadre with resources, information, and step-by-step instructions. Information and processes found in this guide are derived from Air 
Force, Air Education & Training Command, Air University, Holm Center, and AFROTC regulations and resources. Best practices from AFROTC Regions and Sub-Regions have also been incorporated into this guide. 
The AFROTC Detachment Action Guide is a living tool, established with all cadre in mind. This guide has been developed with input from Officers and Enlisted cadre from across the AFROTC enterprise, in an effort to generate the most robust training resource available. The end goal is for this to be the most comprehensive and up-to-date source for accomplishment of detachment-level processes, in support of officer accessions.

# Purpose & Scope

Tuesday, February 1, 2022 9:52 AM

Business Rules Page 2


## The CDT lead, under the supervision of CCVT, is the authority for

## maintaining currency of the Detachment Action Guide. Cadre assigned

## to the CDT are responsible for updating, removing, and/or adding

## information and processes accordingly and in a timely manner. All

## changes to the Detachment Action Guide will support HQ AFROTC, or

## higher HQ, directives, initiatives, programs, and processes. Members

## will establish an internal process for review that ensures currency but,

## does not detract from detachment obligations. The CDT lead and CCVT

## will review and authorize all changes/updates or appoint a CDT

## member to do so.

# Authority & Responsibility

Tuesday, February 1, 2022 9:53 AM

Business Rules Page 3


## The Detachment Action Guide is a living product. It will be reviewed in its entirety

## at least twice annually by the CDT and CCVT. The first full review shall occur

## following CDT turnover. The Detachment Action Guide POC and the CDT lead will

## brief incoming replacements on roles and responsibilities, grant access to edit,

## and provide the current status. The incoming CDT members should aim to make

## any major changes prior to start of the following fall semester.

## A subsequent, full scope, review shall occur at the end of the fall term, prior to

## start of the following spring term.

## Additionally, minor updates will be incorporated monthly and

## notifications/reminders will be issued by CCVT through Teams at the same time as

## ISTs are posted.

# Timeline

## SUBMITTING IDEAS/SUGGESTIONS

## The Detachment Action Guide should be the culmination of efforts of cadre across

## AFROTC enterprise. For that reason, CCVT and the CDT welcome input from the

## field at any time. New ideas/suggestions can be submitted through CCVT-Cadre

## Training Teams page in the ROTC-Reserve Officer Training Corps. All

## ideas/suggestions will be vetted by the CDT and CCVT accordingly, based on

## degree, complexity, feasibility, and/or any other relevant factors. CCVT and the

## CDT have the authority and responsibility to exercise judgement, based on their

## experience and what is best for the enterprise.

## *We ask that cadre keep in mind that this is a living document and updates will be

## addressed in the order of precedence/impact.

## **All CDT members are detachment cadre and will prioritize accordingly, based

## on their workload within their detachments.

Cadet Pay Page 36


The only twoforms you will need in order to get this process started and accomplished is the
Student Management Roster (SMR) and the Detachment's 257 report.

The Student Management Roster: Everything you need to know about ALLcadets
(contracted/not contracted/pursuing etc..) that are apart of ROTC, is in this document.

257 Report: lists ONLYcontracted cadets.

------------------------------------------------------------

How to pull/find documents:

SMR:

```
○Log into Wings and Click on Cadet Reports
```
```
○Make sure it is under the "Enrolled/Loss" Tab
```
- Click on "SMR"
- Org ID will always be 1218, do not input any other information.
- Click Ok
- A new window will pop up, that is the SMR.

257:

- While you are still logged into Wings and inside "Cadet Reports"
- Click on the tab "Tuition/Pay"

257 How-to
Wednesday, November 24, 2021 12:15 PM

Cadet Pay Page 37


- Click on "Monthly Pay Status"
- The example below will show you how the next screen will look like:

```
The 257 report usually gets dropped the last week of each month, every first week of
each month log into WINGS -> Cadet Reports -> tuition/pay -> Monthly Pay Status
and verify that they have dropped the 257 report.
```
-

```
The "date prepared" should always be from the previous month that you are in
(Example.. it is the first week of march, I will be looking for Feb's 257 report)
```
-
- Click "ok" and the 257 report will pop up.

The Verification Process

```
First things first, before auditing both the SMR and 257 it's important to know AS
levels/stipend entitlements.
```
-

```
*VERY IMPORTANT*
```
- ONLY cadets who are CONTRACTED will be getting paid.
- Below are the AS Levels and their subsistence pay:

Step 1:

```
Now that we have covered how to pull up the SMR and 257 let's do our monthly audit
and make sure the cadets are getting paid!
```
-
- Print out a copy of both your SMR and 257 report.
- The first document you will be reviewing will be the SMR.

Step 2: (Reviewing the SMR)

```
When you are reviewing the SMR you will be looking for various things. I'm going to
break down for what you will look for in GMC contracted cadets (AS 100-200) (250)
and contracted POCs (300-400) (700/800). GMC can only contract if they have met
all scholarship activation requirements. POC will be contracting after they have
completed field training, will contract in the fall semester (NLT 10 calendar days
from host term start date)
```
-

Cadet Pay Page 38


GMC CONTRACTED CADETS (AS 100-200) (250):

```
When reviewing the SMR for GMC contracted cadets you will be verifying that their
scholarship was "Activated". This means they have contracted with the AF.
```
-
- Below you will see an example of how you can tell if a GMC is contracted!

```
Not only have I highlighted virtually on this "how to" but that is also what I do when
I am auditing, so it'll be easier for me to know who is contracted. It'll help you as
well!
```
-

```
As you can see the above cadet is a GMC cadet due to being an AS 100 and is
contracted with the AF due to his "Schlr Stat" being activated. You will continue this
process until you get to the AS 300s. Congrats you are done verifying GMC cadets!
```
-

POC CADETS (AS 300-400) (700/800):

```
When reviewing the SMR for POC cadets you will be verifying that they have an
enlisted grade and the date they contracted.
```
-

```
Below you will see an example of how you can tell if a POC is contracted. 99% of
POC's all contract the Fall Semester after Field Training. The 1% are members who
are guard/reserve that won't contract until 1 month out from Commissioning.
```
-

```
Not only have I highlighted virtually on this "how to" but that is also what I do when
I am auditing, so it'll be easier for me to know who is contracted. It'll help you as
well!
```
-

Congrats you are now done verifying all contracted cadets!

Step 3: (reviewing the 257 report)

```
When you are reviewing the 257 you will be looking for various things. After you
have finished reviewing the SMR, you will now verify that everyone who is
contracted is getting paid appropriately on their 257. I have attached a screen shot of
what each AS level's pay grade will be and how much they will be paid. Scroll up to
"Subsistence Amount for Contract Cadets". That will come in handy when reviewing
pay amount.
```
-
- Below you will see how to read a 257.

```
Name Pay Rank Sex Pay (Book Fees)
```
Start process:

```
Print out your 257 and start matching names with the SMR. For example "Cadet John
Doe, is an AS 100 GMC but has a HSSP (high school scholarship)" so if members
scholarship is activated he will be getting paid $300 on the 257.
```
-

```
I will then review the 257 and verify he is getting paid the correct amount. Just like I
did with my SMR, where I highlighted information. I will be doing the same exact
```
-

Cadet Pay Page 39


```
did with my SMR, where I highlighted information. I will be doing the same exact
thing for the 257, it's just easier for you to track who is good to go.
```
```
You will continue this process until you have verified everyone from who was listed
as a contract cadet (or who you highlighted) is getting paid.
```
-
- Below is an example of how to match up the 257 and SMR.
- Cadet O'Malley is an AS100 which means his pay grade is SC01, $300.
- I will repeat this process until I have verified everyone has been paid!

Step 4: (review any mistakes)
As you know with every program not everything is always going to be correct. Here
are some common mistakes you may run into and how-to fix them.

-

```
1.Cadet not being paid correct amount of money.
2.Cadet stops getting paid.
3.Contract Cadet not on the 257 report.
```
```
Below is our routing process of where to correct or find out more information about a
cadets pay.
```
-
- Click on financials

```
If you look at the below picture, I had to click on "Cadet Pay -Review" to have "Pay
information at DFAS" pop up.
```
-
- Search any cadet, you only have to fill out just one of the criteria's listed.
- Below is an example of a Cadets "Pay information at DFAS"

Cadet Pay Page 40


```
The tab "Bank Data" has all the Cadets Bank information listed. This is the first place
I look to see why a cadet is not getting paid or not on the 257. I do that to make sure
the member gave us his bank info to get paid.
```
-

```
If you look at the very bottom of the below picture you will see a paper clip next to
SF Form 1199A -this is their Direct Deposit form (Circled in Blue). This form is
done when a member contracts and you are starting their pay (Continuity on this
process is under "Cadet Pay 101 Start Pay Forms"). I click on the paper clip to make
sure that the Bank info in WINGS is the same that the member filled out.
```
-

```
When I see that the information is correct or I have made any changes by clicking
save and going into "Proceed to Cadet Transactions to update DFAS" (this is where
you go to update ANYTHING in Cadet Pay, Continuity for this will be under "Cadet
Pay 101 How-to WINGS Slides") I go ahead and click on the "Academic Level" tab.
```
-
- Once I am in "academic level" I go ahead and look at two things

```
I verify that they are under the correct Academic Level. *Again remember* any
changes made to cadets pay must be saved and gone into "Proceed to Cadet
Transactions to update DFAS" (this is where you go to update ANYTHING in
Cadet Pay).
```
```
a.
```
```
I verify that their Estimated Last Day of Pay has not passed. (For training on
Estimated Last Day of Pay, click under "Cadet Pay 101 How-to WINGS
slides").
```
```
b.
```
```
Second place you can look at, to see why a cadet was not getting paid is in Cadet
Transactions.
```
-

```
While already in Financials, click the top left tab "Cadet -Pay Build" and then click
"Cadet Transactions"
```
-

Cadet Pay Page 41


```
"Cadet Transactions"
```
- Search member

```
Everything listed should be all updates you have made for a cadet. From building
their record, to changing banks and AS levels etc.
```
-
- User ID lets you know who submitted each request.

```
Now the reason this is section comes in handy is because when you click on "details"
you can see if something went wrong in the system when updating any cadet
information.
```
-
- Below is an example of one of our cadets who was not on the 257 report.

Story Line: one of our cadets switched banks. A month passed by and the 257 auditor realized
and quickly notified the member they needed to give us the new bank information. The member
did and the Cadre updated it.

The next month came around and the cadet still wasn't getting paid, so we then went into "Cadet
Transactions" to find out what happened. HQ ended up having an issue with building all new
cadet records at DFAS.

- This was all resolved due to the CADRE reviewing Cadet Pay records.
- Now that you have reviewed and verified everything, lets finalize the 257.

Step 5: Finalizing 257 Report

```
When you are finalizing the 257 you must due 6 things before handing it off to the
"Auditor" (usually an APAS)
```
-

```
Pull up a new current 257 (the one you just reviewed should be covered in
highlighter) (scroll up if you forgot how to do)
```
```
1.
Once you have it pulled up, Scroll all the way to the bottom of the 257 and input all
the findings that you saw (below is an example of how I explain the findings and
what actions I have taken to either resolve or explain discrepancies)
```
```
2.
```
```
After you have explained the findings, please copy the below signature blocks (they
are not on the 257 report)
```
```
1.
```
```
CADET PAY MONITOR SIGNATURE: _________________(you sign
```

```
1.Sign next to Cadet Pay Monitor, you will then give the APAS 3 different documents.
```
```
a. Highlighted SMR
b. Highlighted 257
c.Finalized 257 (you just signed it)
```
```
He will then due the same identification process and audit his findings.
```
```
Now that the APAS has signed off, you will then schedule an Appt with the CC.
Explain to him/her ANY findings and he/she will then sign.
```
```
5.
```
```
Take finalized 257 and place it in the "257 Reports" binder so that when your det is
having a "Self-Assessment" you will be compliant.

On the day of orientation, the cadre will verify the birth certificate, social
security card, selective service (for males 18+), and ensure the student has no
civil involvements to report. (If the student reports civil involvements, they will
meet with the CC in a separate NSO group).
The students will be broken up into four groups:
```
- Alpha-HSSP NSO (will follow c/POC to separate room)
- Bravo-Stayed in place (auditorium)
- Charlie-Civil Involvements (will follow c/POC to separate room)
- Delta-New shows (will follow c/POC to separate room)
    *** These are just suggestions, and can be applied/changed as
    necessary to fit detachment needs.***

```

Welcome
```
New Student Orientation Page 58


```
Welcome
```
```
I'm Technical Sergeant Anastacia Harris, the Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge for
Detachment 157. On behalf of the Commander, Colonel Alan Dayton, I'd like to thank you
for your interest in the AFROTC program and your interest in pursuing a commission in the
US Air Force or US Space Force.
```
```
Our detachment has existed since 1972 and has many traditions and standardized ways of
training our cadets. As things get back to "normal" from COVID-19, we will be
transitioning into being in larger groups and forums. Our cadre asks for your flexibility and
understanding as we navigate the new norm and get back to operating at full capacity this
school year.
```
```
As a cadet in AFROTC, we expect that you maintain personal accountability and
motivation for yourself, progress, and academic careers. You will have to maintain your
own fitness, navigate technological and communication challenges, and find a way to
build camaraderie among your peers. The cadre, along with your cadet wing and leaders
will be with you every step of the way!
```
```
Some of you will rise to this challenge and flourish despite the many obstacles you'll be
faced with. Others will not, and will quit the program or not even finish the application
process. That's ok, we expect both, as only 1 in 4 freshmen that join the program will
commission as an officer.
```
```
New Student Orientation Process (NSOP)
```
```
Please carefully work your way through this process with the utmost attention to detail.
We have tried to streamline the process as much as possible, but you may still have

and determined they could join the det as a cadet. After all other checkboxes on the
Enrollment/Classification page in WINGS are 'green,' this is how the cadets log in to certify
that they have no other civil involvements to report, and is the last step to take before
you can make them an active cadet! Also, you have to make them active within
approximately 24 hours of them signing this page, or it'll expire and you'll have to do it
again!
```
```

# Classifying a Cadet

Wednesday, November 24, 2021 11:37 AM

New Student Orientation Page 66


Step 4: On the left hand side of the page, select "Enrollment/Classification" and verify/complete necessary

actions to be able to classify the cadet as "active"

○ Find the applicant you are working with.

- You will see a table with a series of boxes like this:

```
If you see a blank box, no action has been taken; if there is a green check mark, action is complete; if
there is a red X, then a follow-up action needs to be made ( you may see this on: CIs, CI Certification,
Screening Questions)
```
- If the box is blank or does not have a green check, select the box to see what action is required.

***ACTIONS TO COMPLETE***

Enrollment Eligibility:

```
Using the original or certified true copies of the Birth Certificate, Passport (for citizenship), and
Social Security Card, verify the information in this box is accurate. Once information is verified,
place your cursor in the blank box in the upper right corner of the section and click in the box so a
green check appears (see example below).
```
-

```
Next, use the BC, passport, or proof of naturalization to verify citizenship. Once verified, toggle the
box that says, "I have reviewed this individuals original birth certificate, proof of naturalization, or
current U.S. passport to certify U.S. citizenship." If the cadet is a "Non-US" citizen, see the Non-
U.S. citizen tab of this OneNote.
```
-

```
Once all of the boxes are green, you will be able to move on and the "Enrollment Eligibility" box
will have a green check in it on the home page.
```
-

New Student Orientation Page 67


Youth/Military Experience:

```
If the applicant has not prior military experience, the option will be toggled no. If yes, then you will
need the applicant's DD214. If the applicant is male and 18 years of age or older, input their
selective service number if the box is blank.
```
-
- Indicate whether or not the applicant has JROTC experience.
    Verify whether or not the applicant has indicated awards, scouting experience, or prior officer
    training
       Awards and experience are important when it comes to contracting because it can influence
       their pay grade

```
○
```
-

```
After all of the information has been verified, select the boxes in the upper right corner of each
section, then click "apply" and then "ok" (example below).
```
-

New Student Orientation Page 68


Screening Questions:

```
Make sure these are all checked with a green check. If they are incomplete, have the applicant
complete their questions. If there is a red X, additional actions must be taken. Typically these
actions are related to DoDMERB (click the red X associated with this question and indicate the
action that will be taken. i.e. requesting DoDMERB be transferred to the det) or admission of drug
use (officer cadre will have to meet with the cadet to sign this one off. They will click on the red X
and then indicate action taken). When complete, all the boxes will be green (see below example).
```
-

New Student Orientation Page 69


Application Documents:

**Reference: AFROTCI 36-2011V3, 31 March 2022**

**5.3. FA, Body Mass Index (BMI), and Body Fat Standards.** PFA, BMI and body fat standards remain part

of accession physical standards and are used as entry criteria for AFROTC consistent with DoDI 1308.03,
DoD Physical Fitness and Body Fat Programs Procedures, and AFMAN 36-2905, Fitness Program.

```
5.3.1. Contract cadets and cadets competing for an EA must successfully meet current Air Force
physical fitness and body composition requirements IAW AFMAN 36-2905 and this supplement.
Unless exempted for temporary athletic body composition waiver, cadets are expected to
maintain DoD BMI standards, abdominal circumference measurement screening or BF standards
over their entire cadet career. Cadets are responsible for monitoring caloric intake and personal
exercise programs to maintain the required body composition standards. Detachment
Commanders are the OPR for administering and monitoring cadet compliance with these
standards.
```
```
5.3.2. All cadets are responsible for meeting BMI or Body Fat standards in order to activate a
scholarship, meet the PSP selection board, attend Field Training, contract, and commission. If over
BMI, conduct body fat measurement according to procedures in DoDI 1308.03. Cadets under the
minimum BMI standard require a one-time evaluation by a physician to ensure there are no
underlying medical conditions. Cadets are disqualified if not medically cleared. Cadets over the
maximum BMI standard who are athletes must have a temporary athletic body composition
waiver in their cadet record.
```
```
5.3.2.1. All cadets must meet BMI or Body Fat standards within 30 days prior to the
scholarship activation date, PSP selection board nomination date, and commission. Cadets
covered by the temporary athletic body composition waiver may receive a scholarship or
meet the PSP selection board but must meet the BMI/BF standards for commissioning.
```
```
5.3.2.2. All cadets must meet BMI or Body Fat standards within 30 days prior to the end of
the spring term immediately before Field Training attendance except for those covered by
the temporary athletic body composition waiver. Contact AFROTC/DOF to remove the FT
assignment for any cadet that fails to meet the standards.
```
```
5.3.2.3. All cadets must meet BMI or Body Fat standards within 15 days prior to contracting
except for those covered by the temporary athletic body composition waiver.
```
**5.3.3.** Det/CCs must issue a CE for contract cadets who fail to meet Body Fat standards at designated
times stated in Table 5.4. A contract cadet who receives a CE during the semester for failure to meet

Body Fat standards is required to meet the standards within 30 days into the next term or the Det/CC
will initiate a CRR or investigate for disenrollment.

**5.3.4.** Det/CCs may issue a CE or Det Drop any cadet that does not meet Body Fat standards at any time

not explicitly stated in Table 5.4.

**5.3.5.** Do not activate a scholarship, submit for the PSP selection board, contract, send to Field Training,

or commission if a cadet does not meet BMI or Body Fat standards except for those covered by the
temporary athletic body composition waiver.
