## Purpose & Scope
The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) Detachment Action Guide is an interactive and collaborative tool developed and managed by the Cadre Development Team (CDT), under the guise of AFROTC/CCVT, Cadre Training. This guide is designed to provide cadre with resources, information, and step-by-step instructions. Information and processes found in this guide are derived from Air Force, Air Education & Training Command, Air University, Holm Center, and AFROTC regulations and
resources. Best practices from AFROTC Regions and Sub-Regions have also been incorporated into this guide. The AFROTC Detachment Action Guide is a living tool, established with all cadre in mind. This guide has been developed with input from Officers and Enlisted cadre from across the AFROTC enterprise, in an effort to generate the most robust training resource available. The end goal is for this to be the most comprehensive and up-to-date source for accomplishment of detachment-level processes, in support of officer accessions.

## How to Use the Det Action Guide


## Authority & Responsibility
The CDT lead, under the supervision of CCVT, is the authority for maintaining currency of the Detachment Action Guide. Cadre assigned to the CDT are responsible for updating, removing, and/or adding information and processes accordingly and in a timely manner. All changes to the Detachment Action Guide will support HQ AFROTC, or higher HQ, directives, initiatives, programs, and
processes. Members will establish an internal process for review that ensures currency but, does not detract from detachment obligations. The CDT lead and CCVT will review and authorize all changes/updates or appoint a CDT member to do so.
 
## Timeline
The Detachment Action Guide is a living product. It will be reviewed in its entirety at least twice annually by the CDT and CCVT. The first full review shall occur following CDT turnover. The Detachment Action Guide POC and the CDT lead will brief incoming replacements on roles and responsibilities, grant access to edit, and provide the current status. The incoming CDT members should aim to make any major changes prior to start of the following fall semester.
 
A subsequent, full scope, review shall occur at the end of the fall term, prior to start of the following spring term.
 
Additionally, minor updates will be incorporated monthly and notifications/reminders will be issued by CCVT through Teams at the same time as ISTs are posted.
 
## Submitting Ideas/Suggestions
The Detachment Action Guide should be the culmination of efforts of cadre across AFROTC enterprise. For that reason, CCVT and the CDT welcome input from the field at any time. New ideas/suggestions can be submitted through CCVT-Cadre Training Teams page in the ROTC-Reserve
Officer Training Corps. All ideas/suggestions will be vetted by the CDT and CCVT accordingly, based on Business Rules degree, complexity, feasibility, and/or any other relevant factors. CCVT and the CDT have the authority and responsibility to exercise judgement, based on their experience and what is best for the enterprise.
 
We ask that cadre keep in mind that this is a living document and updates will be addressed in the order of precedence/impact.
 
All CDT members are detachment cadre and will prioritize accordingly, based on their workload within their detachments.
