## EAD Roster QC
**Step 1: **Filter out the Detachment so you are only seeing members of your unit.

***NOTE***: Below are the main tabs you really need to QC

**Step 2: **Verify all the information is correct

- (DOC) Date of Commission: Make sure this is what is reflected in WINGS when you have "LOSS" the 2d Lt. If cadet has not Commissioned yet, just leave it as it is. More will explained below on proper correcting procedures.

- (EAD) Extended Active Duty Date: this is a MAJOR section. If there is any date besides the last day of the fiscal year the 2d Lt commissions in (30 SEP 20XX) then you are good. However, if you have a "placeholder date" (30 SEP), that means AFPC is missing information for the 2d Lt in order to get then their real EAD.

- Rated members: IFC Physical DD Form 2808/TS status (only has to be opened (verify the AFSC doesn't specify adjudication))

	Nonrated members: SOD Physical (Space Operations)/MOD Physical (PRP related jobs)/TS Adjudicated Status
